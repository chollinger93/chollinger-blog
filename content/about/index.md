This is my blog. 

I'm a software engineer that works in "data" (I believe they call that "Data Platform Engineer") and I usually work on distributed data processing systems, mostly in `Scala`, `Python`, and some `go`.

If you got here via the link on my CV, I *naturally* mean "I develop high-performance, enterprise-grade, world-scale distributed microservices with event-driven AI enhanced architectures and `${currentHypeTech}` that process PiB of data every `${timeUnit}` using `${hypeLanguage}`". Or something.

I usually write about stuff I simply find interesting, so that I have an excuse to spend more time with it (and I believe you only really understand something you can explain to others).

Rarely do I claim to be an expert in those topics. If you find something that you deem is incorrect, you're more than welcome to reach out and I'd happily correct it.
